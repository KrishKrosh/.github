Hi! I'm originally from a very small town in northern Canada, called Fort McMurray. As a result, I spent most of my days avoiding the cold and learning to code in my room.

Nowadays, I have a lot of bad ideas. While I'm not at school at the University of Waterloo I try my best to make my bad ideas a reality!
